# üìò MetaVox ‚Äì Metadata for Nextcloud

**MetaVox** ("Vox‚Äù = voice. Metadata as 'the voice of the document‚Äô.) is an open-source Nextcloud app developed by the University of Amsterdam and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.  
Originally built for education, MetaVox is broadly applicable across government, non-profit, and other professional sectors.

It adds metadata to documents stored in Nextcloud, making them easier to organize, interpret, and retrieve.

## üéØ Purpose

The goal of MetaVox is to enrich digital documents with contextual metadata ‚Äî such as topic, author intent, relevance, or classification ‚Äî in a way that is:

- **Structured** and machine-readable  
- **Non-intrusive** (no changes to file content)  
- **Compatible** with existing Nextcloud workflows  
- **Designed for flexible use across education, government, and other document-driven environments**

## üë• Target Users

MetaVox is suitable for:

- **Universities and educational institutions**  
- **Government organizations**  
- **Knowledge workers in research, legal, and administrative fields**  
- **IT admins and architects deploying metadata-enhanced cloud infrastructure**

## üå± Why MetaVox?

While Nextcloud provides basic metadata capabilities (tags, comments, etc.), MetaVox introduces **rich, structured semantic metadata** to support use cases such as:

- Curriculum and course tagging  
- Policy and compliance classification  
- Research annotation  
- Document lifecycle and role-specific categorization  

# MetaVox - Metadata Management Requirements

## Scope
MetaVox is a Nextcloud app designed to manage metadata specifically for **Team folders**. The goal is to offer controlled, role-based metadata definition and editing, with a clear distinction between **Team folder metadata** and **Document-specific metadata**.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Metadata Scope and Visibility
- [ ] Metadata can only be assigned to **Team folders** and documents **within Team folders**.
- [ ] Metadata must **not** be assignable to personal folders or files.
- [ ] For each document inside a Team folder, the following must be shown:
  - [ ] Team folder metadata (read-only).
    - [ ] Not stored with the document
  - [ ] Document-specific metadata (editable depending on permissions).

### 2. Team folder Metadata Management
- [ ] Only **administrators** can define or modify Team folder metadata.
- [ ] Metadata types for Team folders must be configurable per folder.
- [ ] Team folder metadata definitions are created independently of document metadata definitions.
- [ ] Admins can import Team folder metadata definitions via a predefined `.json` format.
- [ ] Admins can export Team folder metadata definitions into a predefined `.json` format.

### 3. Document Metadata within Team folders
- [ ] Metadata can be assigned to individual documents inside Team folders.
- [ ] Only users with **edit permissions** on the document may edit document-specific metadata.
- [ ] Users with **read-only access** may view but **not** modify metadata.
- [ ] Metadata editing rights should **inherit the document‚Äôs permissions**.
- [ ] Admins can import Document metadata definitions via a predefined `.json` format.
- [ ] Admins can export Document metadata definitions into a predefined `.json` format.

---

## Permissions & Roles
- [ ] Metadata definitions (Team folder and document level) can only be created/modified by users with the **admin role**.
- [ ] Regular users may only **view or edit** document metadata based on their **access level** to the document.

---

## User Interface Requirements
- [ ] Metadata associated with a Team folder must be **clearly visible** when browsing the folder.
- [ ] When viewing a document, the interface must distinguish between:
  - [ ] Metadata shown from the Team folder (read-only).
  - [ ] Metadata specific to the document (editable if user has permission).

---

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] JSON schema must be defined for importing metadata definitions
- [ ] App must ensure metadata integrity and prevent unauthorized changes.
- [ ] Integration with Nextcloud‚Äôs permission system is required.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Compatibility with the latest stable version of Nextcloud.
- [ ] Localization-ready (multi-language support).
- [ ] Performance should not be significantly impacted by large metadata sets.

---

## Future Considerations
- [ ] Each metadata field may have an optional **default value**.
  - [ ] JSON import support for default values  
- [ ] Versioning of metadata definitions.
- [ ] Audit logs for metadata changes.
- [ ] Metadata must be **searchable** via Nextcloud‚Äôs global search.
- [ ] Metadata must be **filterable** in search results (e.g., by metadata field values).
