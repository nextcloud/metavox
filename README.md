# metavox
MetaVox ("Vox” = voice. Metadata as 'the voice of the document’.) is an open-source Nextcloud app developed by the University of Amsterdam and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. It adds a semantic metadata layer to documents stored in Nextcloud, making them easier to organize, interpret, and retrieve.
