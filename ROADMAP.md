## üìå Planned

### Search on metadata 
- Search on the values of the MetaVox fields from the Nextcloud unified search
- Update the search index for modified (created, deleted, updated) metadata

### Retaining metadata on copy action 
- When a folder (with all folders and files in it) or file is copied, the metadata is also copied
- When a folder (with all folders and files in it) or file is deleted, the metadata is also deleted
- When a folder (with all folders and files in it) or file is restored, the metadata is also restored

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced features

### Retention Policies
- Archive or delete data based on metadata  
- Configurable policies (e.g. time-based or type-based)  
- Administrative controls for compliance and data management  

### AI integration
- AI-powered metadata extraction (automatically generate metadata based on document contents)
  - Per document and per team folder

### More granular permissions
- Team folder owners can configure metadata fields for their own team folders

### Infinite Scrolling for Team Folders
- Add infinite scrolling to Team Folders to improve performance with large folder sets

## üí° Future Ideas
*(Not scheduled yet, under consideration)*   
- Integration with Nextcloud Flow for automated actions  
- Reporting on usage and retention
- More advanced field types
- Implement support for domain-specific metadata standards (e.g., Dublin Core) to improve interoperability and semantic consistency across research and content management workflows.

## üåç Long-Term Vision
*(Exploratory goals, subject to funding and partnerships)*  

### Integration with European 6G Initiatives
- Explore opportunities to align Metavox with European 6G research and innovation projects  
- Potential funding applications to support advanced metadata-driven voice archiving and compliance use cases  
- Position Metavox within next-generation telecommunications and cloud ecosystems
